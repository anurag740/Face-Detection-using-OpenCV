# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates a basic face detection system using OpenCV and Python. The system utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier for detecting faces in images.

Key Features:

Face Detection: Detects faces in images using OpenCV's CascadeClassifier.

Image Processing: Converts images to grayscale to enhance detection accuracy.

Drawing Rectangles: Highlights detected faces with rectangles for visual confirmation.


Code Overview:
Haar Cascade Classifier: Used to load pre-trained models for face detection.

Image Reading and Displaying: Uses cv2.imread and cv2.imshow to read and display images.

Grayscale Conversion: Converts colored images to grayscale for better detection.

Face Detection Parameters: Configurable parameters such as scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize to fine-tune detection.

Example Usage:
Load an image using OpenCV.
Convert the image to grayscale.
Apply the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces.
Draw rectangles around detected faces.
Display the results.

Dependencies:
OpenCV
Google Colab (for running the notebook)

How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the face detection in action.

Future Improvements:
Implement real-time face detection using webcam.
Integrate more advanced models like deep learning-based detectors.
